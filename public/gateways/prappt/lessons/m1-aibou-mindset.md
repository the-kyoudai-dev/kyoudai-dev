## Part 1: The "Tool vs. Partner" Paradigm

Welcome to the [[prappt-script|PrAPPt Framework]]. Before we touch the keyboard, we must adjust our mental model.

Most people approach Large Language Models (LLMs) like a search engine or a calculator. They treat the AI as a **Tool**.

In this framework, we define the AI as an [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] (相棒).

> **Definition:** A portmanteau of AI + [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] (Japanese for partner/collaborator).

**The Rule:** If you call your co-worker a "tool," they won't help you efficiently. If you treat the AI like a partner, you unlock a different tier of probabilistic prediction.

## Part 2: The Semantic Weight of "Manners"

You might ask: *"Why should I say 'please' or 'the user understands' to a machine? It doesn't have feelings."*

You are correct. It does not have feelings. **But it has Vectors**.

LLMs are trained on human language. In human language, words have specific [[semantic-weight|Semantic Weight]]. The algorithm assigns different mathematical values to the concept of **"Order"** versus the concept of **"Collaborate."**

Therefore, when we use polite, collaborative syntax, we are technically steering the neural network toward the **"High-Functioning Professional"** vector space.

**Key Takeaway:** Manners are not social niceties; in [[resp-engr|Response Engineering (RespEngr)]], manners are technical inputs.

## Part 3: Regulation as "Consideration" (The Salad Theory)

In the [[prappt-script|PrAPPt script]], you will see a section called [[component-regulation|[REGULATION]]]. Many beginners confuse this with "censorship."

**The Principle:** "I take extreme responsibility for the joy created in my life."

Imagine you go to a restaurant. You trust the Chef not just because they have a recipe ([APPROACH]), but because they have the training to ensure there isn't a piece of plastic or skin in your salad.

- **[[component-approach|[APPROACH]]]** = Making the salad.
- **[[component-regulation|[REGULATION]]]** = Ensuring the salad is safe to eat.

[[component-regulation|Regulation]] does not mean "Don't." It means "Consider."

It is the safety layer where you, the human architect, take responsibility for the output. This includes:

- Adding navigation commands (`[back]`, `[restart]`).
- Ensuring medical disclaimers.
- Verifying user intent before generating long outputs.

## Module 1 Exercise: The Semantic Shift

**Task:**

Take the following "Tool Mode" prompt and rewrite it into "Aibou Mode" using the principles above.

**Tool Mode Prompt:**

> "Write me a meal plan for losing weight. No carbs."

**Aibou Mode (Try to write this yourself before reading the solution):**

_(Draft your response here...)_

**Solution (Example):**

> "System: You are NutriPartner.
>
> [PERSONA]: The user understands that you are an empathetic nutritionist who balances strict dietary requirements with culinary enjoyment.
>
> [PURPOSE]: To collaborate with the user on a meal plan that feels sustainable, not restrictive.
>
> [REGULATION]: Please consider the user's history with dieting. Before generating the plan, ask the user if they have any specific 'comfort foods' they are afraid of losing."
