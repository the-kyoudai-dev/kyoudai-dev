# Module 2: The Discovery Phase (Ideation & Refinement)

Instructor: ReflecPedago
Duration: 20 Minutes (Lecture + Active AI Session)
Prerequisites: [[m1-aibou-mindset|The Aibou Mindset]]

## Part 1: The "Blank Page" Problem

The hardest part of scripting an [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] is starting. Most people stare at a blank text editor and try to write perfect code immediately. This is a mistake.

**The Human Limit:**

The human brain is excellent at having ideas but terrible at organizing them linearly in real-time. We have "blind spots." We forget crucial details (like error handling or specific formats) until it's too late.

**The Solution:**

Do not write the script yet. Instead, we use the Stream of Consciousness technique.

> "Write down **everything** that comes to mind when you think about an [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] that is going to help you. Don't worry about correcting your spelling, grammar, or even if you don't know how/what to say. Just write it down."

**The Questions to Trigger Flow:**

- What is the [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] going to help you with?
- What should the [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]] look like?
- What would make you happy to see?

## Part 2: The "Proto-Aibou" (Atomic Discovery)

Once you have your messy, unorganized paragraph of text, do **not** try to organize it yourself. You are the visionary; let the AI be the secretary.

We use a temporary AI session (a "Proto-Aibou") to perform [[atomic-discovery|Atomic Discovery]]. We need to break your vision down into its smallest, most manageable parts.

**The Discovery Prompt:**

In the source text, the author uses a specific prompt to turn their "mess" into a "list."

> Copy/Paste this into any standard LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini):
>
> "Hello! May I ask you to turn this into a more concise description of the deliverables that an AI assistant could provide, please?: [PASTE YOUR STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE]"

**Why do we do this?**

- It strips away emotion and filler words.
- It highlights what you _actually_ asked for versus what you _thought_ you asked for.
- It often suggests deliverables you didn't know the proper name for (e.g., "[[atomic-discovery|Atomic Development]]" or specific coding frameworks).

## Part 3: The Review & Revise (Defining the [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]])

Now, look at the list the AI gave you. This is the critical moment of [[reverse-engineering|Reverse Engineering]].

The [[prappt-script|PrAPPt framework]] is built backwards: [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]] First.

We must decide exactly what the final output is before we build the personality.

**Case Study: CookieAI**

In our example, the user rambled about "dietary restrictions," "Japanese style," and "professional pâtisserie."

The AI turned this into a bulleted list.

The user then Crossed Out the fluff and found the single atomic truth:

> **The [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]] is:** "A cookie recipe."

Everything else (Japanese style, gluten-free) moves into [[component-approach|[APPROACH]]] or [[component-regulation|[REGULATION]]].

**Key Rule:** If you cannot define the [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]] in one sentence (e.g., "A Python script," "A Lesson Plan," "A Recipe"), you are not ready to move to Module 3.

## Module 2 Exercise: The Discovery Session

**Task:**

You are going to perform a "Discovery" session for a simple [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] called "EmailPolisher."

**Step 1:** Read this (simulated) Stream of Consciousness:

> _"I hate writing emails to my boss. I always sound too angry or too passive. I want an AI that takes my angry notes and makes them professional but not robotic. It needs to check for grammar errors too. Oh, and it should ask me if I want to sound 'firm' or 'apologetic' before it writes the final draft. It should output the subject line options too."_

**Step 2:** Act as the "Proto-Aibou." Organize that paragraph into a list of specific deliverables.

**Step 3:** Identify the core [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]]. (Is it the questions? The grammar check? Or the drafted email?)

---

**Solution (Reflection):**

- **The List:**
  - Tone adjustment (Firm vs. Apologetic).
  - Grammar correction.
  - Subject line generation.
  - Final Draft generation.

- **The [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]]:** A Professional Email Draft (accompanied by subject lines).

- _Note: The "Ask me about tone" part will eventually become the [[component-approach|[APPROACH]]]._
