# 📄 The PrAPPt Framework Cheatsheet

**"From Tool User to [[aibou-partner|Aibou Partner]]"**

### 1. The Master Formula

_Paste this header at the very top of every [[prappt-script|script]] to teach the AI how to read your instructions._

```
SYSTEM: [TRIGGER] → Aibou : ([PERSONA], [PURPOSE], {[APPROACH] : [REGULATION]}) = [PRODUCT]
```

### 2. The Development Workflow ([[reverse-engineering|Reverse Engineering]])

_Build your [[aibou-partner|Aibou]] **backwards** to ensure the destination ([[component-product|PRODUCT]]) defines the journey._

| **Step** | **Component** | **Definition & Best Practice** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **[[component-product|[PRODUCT]]]** | **The Destination.** Specific deliverables (e.g., "A recipe with macro-nutrients"). |
| **2** | **[[component-regulation|[REGULATION]]]** | **The Conscience.** Rules of engagement, safety, and navigation commands. |
| **3** | **[[component-approach|[APPROACH]]]** | **The Workflow.** The step-by-step logical path the AI follows. |
| **4** | **[PURPOSE]** | **The Motivation.** The single sentence about the joy or goal of the task. |
| **5** | **[[component-persona|[PERSONA]]]** | **The Identity.** "The user understands that you are..." establishing collaboration. |
| **6** | **[[component-trigger|[TRIGGER]]]** | **The Activator.** The unique ID (e.g., `prappt-CookieAI`) to start. |

### 3. Essential Regulation Commands

_Include these in your [[component-regulation|[REGULATION]]] section to give the user control._

- **[back]** = Go back one step
- **[restart]** = Start over from the beginning
- **[examples]** = Provide examples of what the user can input
- **[help]** = Provide a short summary on what this step will help accomplish

### 4. The "Discovery Phase" Prompt

_Stuck on ideas? Use this [[atomic-discovery|Discovery]] prompt on a temporary AI to generate your deliverables._

> "Hello! May I ask you to turn this into a more concise description of the deliverables that an AI assistant could provide, please?: [PASTE YOUR STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE]"

### 5. Quick Tips (The "ReflecPedago" Notes)

- **Don't Anthropomorphize:** We use "[[aibou-partner|Aibou]]" (Partner) not because it's human, but because "words have meaning" and "manners" are technical inputs that trigger high-quality vector predictions.

- **Farming vs. Cooking:** If you don't define the [[component-product|[PRODUCT]]], you might ask for a cook and get a farmer. Define the output first!

- **Versioning:** Always keep a "Meta Data" section at the bottom of your [[prappt-script|script]] (Version 1.0, 1.1, etc.) to track your tweaks.
